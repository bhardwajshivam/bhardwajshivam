## Work Experience

**Research Associate @ Y-RISE (_June 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Building cto.ai, a multi-agent LLM-powered survey generation platform with question recommendation using chain of thought and agentic RAG.
- Developed a causal relation between extracted band values of high resolution satellite images and water-salinity levels incorporating RIDGE, LASSO, Elastic Net, Huber and Bayesian linear regression models.
- Performing temporal analysis of day-time and night-time satellite images (ConvLSTM,  TCN, ST-GCN), integrating power outage and public health data to determine relationship between reliable electricity and economic development in Kenya.


**Data Scientist @ Keelworks (_June 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Developed Anchor (friction-based AI agent) for argumentation enabled co-pilot (using similarity matrices & RAG) to help user decision making, increased engagement and factual argumentation.
- Used post-training static quantization to optimize Mistral 70B (reduced model size and improved response time by 80%).   
- Developed an editor application with chat-bot functionality utilizing anchor and reflex (python wrapper for react.js)


**Data Scientist Intern @ BUSPH (_October 2023 - January 2024_)**
- Automated web scraping (selenium) to create a corpus consisting social/racial equity plans of the top 200 cities in the USA.
- Developed an application to generate optimal number of topics using transformer-based topic modeling algorithm that returns major topics covered in the corpus helping understand racial disparities.
- Leveraged docker to containerize a temporal-CNN pipeline that analyzes Google Street View images of redlined areas over time, enabling chronological insights into racial contexts and structural changes.


**Software Engineer @ Brightchamps (_January 2022 - September 2022_)**
- Built and managed feature computation pipelines and infrastructure for various ML models (churn rate prediction, revenue time series).
- Tested RESTful APIs, optimized backend performance through caching strategies and efficient data retrieval.
- Utilized GCP, developed flask API for XGBoost classifier for predicting customer churn rate with an accuracy of 90.8%.




## Projects
### Reddit RAG ETL
- Designed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow with a Celery backend and PostgreSQL to orchestrate data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- Extracted data from Reddit's API for user-specified topics, leveraging Python-based modules for efficient data retrieval and handling.
- Transformed unstructured Reddit data into a vector database using AWS Glue for ETL operations and advanced text embeddings to enable semantic search and retrieval.
- Integrated AWS services:
S3: For scalable and durable storage of vectorized data.
Athena: To query and analyze structured metadata efficiently.
Glue: For transforming raw JSON data into cleaned, enriched formats.
- Built interactive chat functionality using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to allow users to query data conversationally.
- Developed a user-friendly front end with Streamlit, enabling seamless interaction with the vectorized Reddit data for insights and trend analysis.
- Optimized data pipeline performance through modular design, parallel task execution in Airflow, and efficient use of AWS-managed services.
- Facilitated deep insights into Reddit community trends by enabling semantic queries and engagement pattern analysis across large datasets.
- Ensured scalability and fault tolerance by leveraging distributed processing and cloud-native storage solutions.
- Automated workflow monitoring and logging to track ETL processes and ensure reliable operations.
